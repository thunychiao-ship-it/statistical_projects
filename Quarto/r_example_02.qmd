## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
1 + 1
```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
cars <- c(1,2,3,5,6)
trucks <- c(2,5,8,9)
plot(cars, type = "o", col = "red", ylim = c(0, 12))
lines(trucks, type = "o", pch = 22, lty = 2, col = "blue")
title(main = "Autos", col.main = "purple", font.main = 4)
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).
